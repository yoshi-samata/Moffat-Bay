                    Moffat Bay Marina opened in 1945. What started as a dream for Linus and Rebecca Snoot turned into a reality<br>
                    when John H Riley, the wealthy industrialist and current owner of the marina decided to sell his possessions after <br>
                    his spiritual adviser led him to believe the worls was ending. Luckily for Linus and Rebecca this meant they could purchace<br>
                    the Marina at an end of the world price. Riley tried to prevent the tranfer of ownership after realizing the world didn't end<br>
                    but his attempts to retain ownership through litigation were unsuccesful. Allowing the Snoots to own the Marina they had<br> 
                    had leased a slip in for years. The Snoots began updateing the Marina right away<br>
                    The Snoots worked tirlessly to improve the facilty as did their children, Bob and Sally<br>
                    Snoot who would add the lodge in 1967.Over the years development continued until it became the luxurious <br>
                    Marina you see today. So while you are enjoying your stay, raise a glass to the Snoots who made it all possible.
